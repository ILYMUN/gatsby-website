_“The cyber world is a sort of the Wild, Wild West, and to some degree, we’re asked to be the sheriff” - Barack Obama at Stanford University, February 13th 2015_.’

The 20th century technological revolution, and especially the invention of the internet, brought about a new wave of globalization and the creation of a new space called the “cyber world”. The Covid-19 pandemic has shown how much we rely on technology and to what extent we are all connected. As the cyber world affects so many aspects of our lives, it must be considered when working towards the United Nations’ goals. As Obama’s quote implies, the cyber world is a new frontier for which we need to develop institutions that are lawful, inclusive and fair. Therefore, our conference will focus on the United Nations’ Sustainable Goal 16, “Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions” with debates focused on strengthening our cyber institutions.

We will tackle some obvious global issues such as human and arms trafficking, extremism, the environment and the transparency of information, as well as philosophical and moral issues that explore the ethics of the cyber world and its consequences on individuals, societies and governments. All the issues stem from a greater question about the “Wild, Wild West” of the Cyber world: Are truth, justice, and peace in the balance? This year’s theme will foster intellectually stimulating debates as well as a creative space for personal development. We are ‘digital natives’, directly impacted and even formed by the internet and social media. Debating the cyber world in a formal setting should encourage us to take more responsibility in the use and development of these technologies.

At ILYMUN, we believe that by involving youth in finding solutions and taking action, we can make a difference. Therefore, in addition to our core MUN committees, we will again host the Action Assembly, in which students represent themselves rather than countries in order to work towards real change in their local communities, the International Court of Justice and the Youth Conference for “collège” or middle school students from the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region.
