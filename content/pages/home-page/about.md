subtitle: Ilymun, (International Lyon Model United Nations), is a three-day conference,
  organized by students in Lyon for students from around the world.

---
The theme for ILYMUN this year is **Rights and Freedoms**.

**Rights and Freedoms** are two interconnected  notions that play a fundamental role in both individual and collective laws, as they are structural  concepts of the UN. This year’s conference will explore the implementation, integration, and impact of rights and freedoms around the world through various lenses. 
We can better understand rights as  moral or legal principles entitled to each individual regardless of social affiliation, background, or origin, that are ideally universally possessed by the general public and irrevocably guaranteed by the law. Rights are critical to freedom; the freedom of an individual is protected and ensured by rights, and prevents coercion into an action or decision. It is the state of being free. Over the course of the conference, delegates will - in varying committees - thoroughly examine the intricacies that lie within the encompassing concepts of Rights and Freedoms. Together, they will work to analyze and understand this complex and crucial subject. 

At **ILYMUN**, we believe in creating as many possibilities for youth to collaborate and discover solutions regarding the world they are living in and will grow into, while simultaneously understanding its vast issues. Accordingly, we will once again host our Action Assembly, where students can represent themselves to bring about a change in their communities, instead of speaking for their designated countries in worldwide problems. Furthermore, the Youth Conference will be open for middle school or “collège” students in the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region.
