In 2015, the UN adopted the Sustainable Development Goals, and set targets for 2030. Our conference will focus on Goal 6, Clean water and sanitation, and Goal 14, Life below water. The importance of these two goals is unparalleled. As the UN states, “Water is at the core of sustainable development and is critical for socio-economic development, energy and food production, healthy ecosystems and for human survival itself.” 

In the past few years, the UN has called great attention to issues of water and now states that water is key to securing peace and a sustainable future. Goals 6 and 14 address issues of water scarcity, water security and equal access to water. They also focus on the protection of the earth's essential water resources. These resources have been exploited as a source of power and economic profit, critically jeopardising the health of our oceans, lakes and rivers as well as coastal life. In addition, it is crucial to address the increasing conflicts, ranging from water access to maritime boundaries, which are continually shaping relations between nations. Finally, in a time of great technological surge, various solutions to counter water issues must be considered. Indeed, water issues bear upon all areas of human development and thus impact all of us as well as the health of the earth itself.

  
It is our hope that in debating issues regarding ocean health, water scarcity and health the delegates of ILYMUN 2020 will draft these much-needed policies and reforms.
