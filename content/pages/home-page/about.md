subtitle: Ilymun, (International Lyon Model United Nations), is a three-day conference,
  organized by students in Lyon for students from around the world.

---
The theme for ILYMUN this year is Sovereignty: Law, Land, and Limits.

Sovereignty is a fundamental concept for the UN, one that has been redefined by the rise of globalisation while needing to maintain its individual implications. The conference will focus on the different subdivisions being impacted around the world. For example, how border and territorial disputes are imposing ineffable consequences on people globally and how they are being forced to adapt. This is only a small part of the enveloping concept that is Sovereignty, and the concepts of “Law”, “Land”, and its “Limits” will be thoroughly explored either individually or jointly within the different committees. Together, delegates will work together on a mission to conquer this complex and crucial subject which must be addressed.

At ILYMUN, we believe in creating as many possibilities for youth to collaborate and discover solutions regarding the world they are living in and will grow into, while simultaneously understanding its vast issues. Accordingly, we will once again host our Action Assembly, where students can represent themselves to bring about a change in their communities, instead of  speaking for their designated countries in worldwide problems. Furthermore, the Youth Conference will be open for middle school or “collège” students in the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region. We also strive to provide delegates with a wide variety of perspectives on global events, and have thus implemented several brand-new committees to ILYMUN 2023: the African Union and the Arctic Council will allow delegates to explore complex and intricate issues through the eyes of the countries that live them on a daily basis. The UNOOSA (United States Office for Outer Space Affairs) will make the conference transcend the limits of Earth to reflect upon the issue of sovereignty in space.

At ILYMUN, we believe that by involving youth in finding solutions and taking action, we can make a difference. Therefore, in addition to our core MUN committees, we will again host the Action Assembly, in which students represent themselves rather than countries in order to work towards real change in their local communities, the International Court of Justice and the Youth Conference for “collège” or middle school students from the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region.
