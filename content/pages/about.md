We have the utmost pleasure and privilege to invite your Model United Nations students to the eleventh annual edition of the International Lyon Model United Nations conference. Due to covid-19, last year was our first in person conference since 2020 and we are very glad that we are able to do it again this year.  This three-day conference is organized by the Cité Scolaire Internationale de Lyon and the International School of Lyon. This year, the conference will be held at the Cité Scolaire Internationale (2 Pl. de Montréal, 69007 Lyon) and at the International School of Lyon (80 Chemin du Grand Roule, 69110 Sainte-Foy-lès-Lyon) in France. The conference will take place from the 1st to the 3rd of February 2024. The theme for ILYMUN this year is Rights and Freedoms.

Rights and Freedoms are two interconnected notions that play a fundamental role in both individual and collective laws, as they are structural concepts of the UN. This year’s conference will explore the implementation, integration, and impact of rights and freedoms around the world through various lenses. We can better understand rights as moral or legal principles entitled to each individual regardless of social affiliation, background, or origin, that are ideally universally possessed by the general public and irrevocably guaranteed by the law. Rights are critical to freedom; the freedom of an individual is protected and ensured by rights, and prevents coercion into an action or decision. It is the state of being free. 

Over the course of the conference, delegates will - in varying committees - thoroughly examine the intricacies that lie within the encompassing concepts of Rights and Freedoms. Together, they will work to analyze and understand this complex and crucial subject.

At ILYMUN, we believe in creating as many possibilities for youth to collaborate and discover solutions regarding the world they are living in and will grow into, while simultaneously understanding its vast issues. Accordingly, we will once again host our Action Assembly, where students can represent themselves to bring about a change in their communities, instead of speaking for their designated countries in worldwide problems. Furthermore, the Youth Conference will be open for middle school or “collège” students in the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region. We also strive to provide delegates with a wide variety of perspectives on global events. 

Explanation of the different committees: 

For ILYMUN 2024, the General Assembly and the United Nations Women will discuss how to eradicate discriminations and end violences against women.

The United Nations Children’s Found (UNICEF), the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) will focus on children’s right to education, human explotation and trafficking as well as freedom of movement.

The Security Council, Historic Security Council and International Court of Justice (ICJ) will debate on different conflicts and genocide that occur/ed around the globe

The World Health Organization (WHO) and the Technology Committee will discourse on the rights and access to healthcare and technology.

The Special Conference will concentrate on freedom of speech and press. And last but not least, the Action Assembly’s theme is « standing up for human rights » which could also be seen as the ultimate goal of the United Nations.

We are absolutely thrilled to be able to hold ILYMUN this year, and will strive to make it the most inclusive, interesting and unforgettable experience yet!

#### History

Taking inspiration from FERMUN in Geneva and THIMUN in the Hague, two students from the Cité Scolaire Internationale, Pierre Mohamed and Kaelan Tardy, reached out to students at the International School of Lyon in order to organise the first ILYMUN conference in 2013. Most of the schools participating in that first conference are now regular participants in our annual conferences and many have gone on to form their own MUN clubs and conferences inspired by ILYMUN. We’re delighted to see these developments: signalling that communities are truly working together towards the bettering of our world!

#### Our Values

##### 1. Inciting Action

Our core objective is to bring about change. Outside of the MUN debates, we hope to extend the resolutions our students conceive, and apply them to the real world. Indeed, by taking action, we hope to contribute to bettering our international community by giving life to delegates’ ideas, with hope of striving towards a greater future. In the light of such, we encourage our delegates to educate themselves regarding these issues, both local and global, and to directly act upon them, externalising ILYMUN’s outreach upon our impaired societies.

##### 2. Enriching Education

We believe that MUN conferences should aim to educate the participants, providing them with essential skills such as public speaking, collaboration with others and critical thinking. MUN opens one’s mind and encourages in-depth reflections on our complex world. ILYMUN helps students grow and become global citizens. Here is a quote from one of our friends at INOMUN in Lille that captures our view of MUN: “The aim of debating is to resolve problems with words, without violence, without deaths. We, high school students, are the next generation. We have to act, we have to do something. An MUN conference won’t literally change things, but it is a way to sharpen our critical minds and our intelligence in order to take over our parents’ generation. In order to bring peace.”

##### 3. Constant Innovation

ILYMUN has matured since its inception by the virtue of original projects, developed every year. Of course, the central issue of the conference varies from year to year, with new branches and new committees created to bring diversification and an improved experience. Undeniably, the feedback from you, fellow participants, permits us to improve an important number of aspects of the conference, making it finer each year!

##### 4. Human Experience

Most diplomats tell you that the most efficient decisions, those which actually change the world, are taken in convivial moments after a day of debate. This is wholly legitimate. Therefore, we keep in mind that an MUN conference is an opportune moment to meet new friends. A few essential factors, unique to ILYMUN, allow you to have real exchanges: small committees (from 20 to 100 persons), country delegations made up of different schools, housing with host families and, of course, social events!

##### 5. By Students, For Students

Even though a very small team of adults supervises our agenda and the organisation of ILYMUN, every aspect of our conference — the vision, planning and execution — is done by high school students who are doing their best to provide middle school and high school delegates and their MUN directors the best possible MUN experience and a professional conference.

##### 6. Social and Ecological Engagements

Bearing in mind the ILYMUN 2016 conference resolutions to tackle Climate Change, we take concrete action to save the Planet, by respecting environmental values. We use a minimal amount of paper and transfer to digital as frequently as possible. We strive to be role models for a green conference.<br/>
The past several years we also have committed to debating the work and the value of various NGOs in our General Assemblies. Delegates then make a vote that leads to real action. The NGO that wins the majority vote receives a financial donation from ILYMUN. This donation is made possible by the wonderful support of our sponsors.

##### 7. Sponsorship

To make ILYMUN truly outstanding, we rely on generous sponsorship from institutions as well as private companies and individuals. We are currently sponsored by the Région Auvergne Rhône-Alpes who have generously provided their premises for the event. By financially helping ILYMUN, you will be effectively helping us reach our goals of providing a professional conference and encouraging young people to work towards positive changes in our world.
