2020 will be the eighth consecutive year in which the International School of Lyon and the Cité Scolaire Internationale de Lyon collaborate to organise ILYMUN. The conference will take place the 30th, 31st January and 1st of February, in the prestigious 'Hôtel de Région Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes' (1 Esplanade François Mitterrand, 69269 Lyon, Cedex 02). We have invited keen and bright high school pupils to join us to debate and take action!

In 2015 the UN adopted 17 goals, the Sustainable Development Goals, and set targets for 2030 in order to improve the quality of life on the planet. The theme of our conference this year, ‘Water: A Thirst for Change’, will focus on Goal 6, Clean water and sanitation, and Goal 14, Life below water. The importance of these two goals is unparalleled. As the UN states, “Water is at the core of sustainable development and is critical for socio-economic development, energy and food production, healthy ecosystems and for human survival itself.”

We believe that by involving youth in finding solutions and taking action, we can make a difference. Therefore, in addition to our core MUN committees, we will once again host the Action Assembly, in which students represent themselves rather than countries in order to work towards real change in their local communities, striving for change through direct action. Additionally, ILYMUN will also be hosting the ‘Youth Conference’ for middle school students from the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region.

We will also offer the Model International Court of Justice (ICJ), a forum that mediates conflicts between two nations by reflecting on treaties, international conventions, and international law. The ICJ is a unique and enriching experience for delegates who wish to try something different to ordinary committees, particularly for those interested in pursuing a career in law.

All in all, we vow to make ILYMUN 2020 an unforgettable and thrilling experience for all its participants!

#### History

Taking inspiration from FERMUN in Geneva and THIMUN in the Hague, two students from the Cité Scolaire Internationale, Pierre Mohamed and Kaelan Tardy, reached out to students at the International School of Lyon in order to organise the first ILYMUN conference in 2013. Most of the schools participating in that first conference are now regular participants in our annual conferences and many have gone on to form their own MUN clubs and conferences inspired by ILYMUN. We’re delighted to see these developments: signalling that communities are truly working together towards the bettering of our world!

#### Our Values

##### 1. Inciting Action

Our core objective is to bring about change. Outside of the MUN debates, we hope to extend the resolutions our students conceive, and apply them to the real world. Indeed, by taking action, we hope to contribute to bettering our international community by giving life to delegates’ ideas, with hope of striving towards a greater future. In the light of such, we encourage our delegates to educate themselves regarding these issues, both local and global, and to directly act upon them, externalising ILYMUN’s outreach upon our impaired societies.

##### 2. Enriching Education

We believe that MUN conferences should aim to educate the participants, providing them with essential skills such as public speaking, collaboration with others and critical thinking. MUN opens one’s mind and encourages in-depth reflections on our complex world. ILYMUN helps students grow and become global citizens. Here is a quote from one of our friends at INOMUN in Lille that captures our view of MUN: “The aim of debating is to resolve problems with words, without violence, without deaths. We, high school students, are the next generation. We have to act, we have to do something. An MUN conference won’t literally change things, but it is a way to sharpen our critical minds and our intelligence in order to take over our parents’ generation. In order to bring peace.”

##### 3. Constant Innovation

ILYMUN has matured since its inception by the virtue of original projects, developed every year. Of course, the central issue of the conference varies from year to year, with new branches and new committees created to bring diversification and an improved experience. Undeniably, the feedback from you, fellow participants, permits us to improve an important number of aspects of the conference, making it finer each year!

##### 4. Human Experience

Most diplomats tell you that the most efficient decisions, those which actually change the world, are taken in convivial moments after a day of debate. This is wholly legitimate. Therefore, we keep in mind that an MUN conference is an opportune moment to meet new friends. A few essential factors, unique to ILYMUN, allow you to have real exchanges: small committees (from 20 to 100 persons), country delegations made up of different schools, housing with host families and, of course, social events!

##### 5. By Students, For Students

Even though a very small team of adults supervises our agenda and the organisation of ILYMUN, every aspect of our conference — the vision, planning and execution — is done by high school students who are doing their best to provide middle school and high school delegates and their MUN directors the best possible MUN experience and a professional conference.

##### 6. Social and Ecological Engagements

Bearing in mind the ILYMUN 2016 conference resolutions to tackle Climate Change, we take concrete action to save the Planet, by respecting environmental values. We use a minimal amount of paper and transfer to digital as frequently as possible. We strive to be role models for a green conference.<br/>
The past several years we also have committed to debating the work and the value of various NGOs in our General Assemblies. Delegates then make a vote that leads to real action. The NGO that wins the majority vote receives a financial donation from ILYMUN. This donation is made possible by the wonderful support of our sponsors.

##### 7. Sponsorship

To make ILYMUN truly outstanding, we rely on generous sponsorship from institutions as well as private companies and individuals. We are currently sponsored by the Région Auvergne Rhône-Alpes who have generously provided their premises for the event. By financially helping ILYMUN, you will be effectively helping us reach our goals of providing a professional conference and encouraging young people to work towards positive changes in our world.
