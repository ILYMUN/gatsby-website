<h3>Our written press team investigates the Humans of ILYMUN</h3>

<p>On the first day of ILYMUN, many people arrived, most of them strangers to us. At first, only one thing seemed to be in common: their smile. So we became inquisitive: why were they here, and what was making them smile so much? Here’s what we found out. <br /><a href="https://medium.com/ilymun-inside-the-conference/ilymun-attendees-experience-70059aceca39">See more</a></p>

<h3>Behind the Scenes of ILYMUN: MUN club at the CSI</h3>

<p>A Model UN Club has been held at the Cité Scolaire Internationale of Lyon for many years. Students get together every Thursday, after school, to debate various topics, often inspired by ongoing events. Ranging from a motion on measures to protect forests, in light of the Australian bushfires, to resolutions on the refugee crisis, students are brought to confront ideas in a setting imitating a United Nations assembly.<br /><a href="https://medium.com/getting-to-know-ilymun/behind-the-scenes-of-ilymun-mun-club-at-the-csi-f4d202c8248a">See more</a></p>
