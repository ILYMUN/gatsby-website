## **A unique committee where your voice is heard!**

### <span style="font-weight: 400;">What is Action Assembly ?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Welcome delegates!
Welcome to the **Action Assembly**! This organ of the conference focuses our efforts on finding change on an accessible level. Unlike the rest of the committees, our work will extend further than a hypothetical view on the events around the world. Since our impact will be more physical, it is also more personal. You have a chance to represent yourselves, not a member-state country. With your unique perspectives you can work on bringing about change within your communities and environment. In the **Action Assembly**, you will then be able to discuss with your fellow delegates and gain feedback and inspiration from the knowledge their perspectives bring them. You will draft an Action Plan to bring about the change you find you are able to do. This action Plan will go through edits throughout the conference until the final version on our final day. From there, you will be able to use your Action Plan to bring about change when you go back home. This means we will keep in contact with you for an update on your work, which we hope will show the effective fruition of your efforts.

### <span style="font-weight: 400;">What is this year’s theme ?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"> This year’s conference theme is **Rights and Freedoms** The Action Assembly will focus on the following topic:

_- Stand up for Human Rights_

</span>

### <span style="font-weight: 400;">What are we going to do ?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"> This year is important for Human Rights. The 10th of December 2023 marks the 75th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR). This document details the rights everyone is entitled to as a human being, no matter what their race, color, religion, sex, language, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth, or other status. Since this year’s Conference is based on Rights and Freedoms, we as the Action Assembly are focusing on Human Rights specifically because of this anniversary. The UDHR is the most translated document in the world, and in honor of the anniversary the UN created a year-long initiative culminating in an event in December 2023 where global pledges and ideas will be announced. As you can see, our Action Assembly will do similar work but on an accessible level, with your own Action Plans reflecting the pledges and ideas the countries in the UN undertake. Later on in this Handbook, we will introduce the UDHR fully so you may use it as inspiration or as a tool when creating your initiatives.

### <span style="font-weight: 400;">How do we prepare for the Action Assembly ?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"></span>

The chairs have prepared a Research Report which gives delegates:

_- more details on the organization of the committee_

_- general information on the topics_

_- sources for additional research_

_- questions to reflect on_

In short, we expect our delegates to have thought about their personal opinions on the topics, as well as have done research on one or more companies, political figures, or countries they will be representing.

### <span style="font-weight: 400;">Why should YOU join the Action Assembly ?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"> This is the committee in which your own voice is heard. The AA works _as a team._ We are all on an equal footing, learning together. The AA _takes action_ towards _real change_. The AA explores different points of view and hosts relevant conversations which lead to fulfilling debates. In the Action Assembly we encourage you to take change into your own hands. With our theme of Human Rights, you have the opportunity to create a serious initiative to produce actual and real change in your environments. As you will work as individuals, please keep in mind the scale of your initiative: a revolution is not made with only one person. However, the spark for change needs only **one voice** to start. Whether you have a long-time issue in your community, find injustices around you, or have to search for a problem, in the Action Assembly you will work to find _change_.

**_So...join us in the Action Assembly and promote action in the world!_**</span>
